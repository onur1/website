> This is my new [website](https://github.com/onur1/website). It still has the old-school design that I like, but all pages are now statically generated&mdash; I ditched Google App Engine!

HTML files are generated using the [template](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/template.html) module from [tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/) and [markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) (with [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) syntax highlighting support).

The typeface that you are currently looking at is called [Proxima Nova](https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova), it is designed by [Mark Simonson Studio](https://www.marksimonson.com). Headings are [Code Pro](https://www.fontfabric.com/fonts/code-pro/) from [Fontfabric](https://www.fontfabric.com). I use the system-default fonts for code blocks, these are Menlo, Monaco on macOS and Consolas, Courier on others. GitHub and Twitter icons are from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library and generated using the [Fontello](https://fontello.com/) icon font generator.

For the styling, I use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), along with [Neat](https://neat.bourbon.io/) for the grid layout support and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for resetting browser defaults.
